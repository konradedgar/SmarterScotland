# Introduction

The following packages makes use of the SPARQL[^1] language queries in order to query the data available through the [statistics.gov.scot](http://statistics.gov.scot) portal[^2]. In effect, the app works as a wrapper for SPARQL queries providing a suite of common functionalities relevant to how the Scottish public data is being utilises.

# Workflow

The proposed workflow looks at obtaning *life expectancy* data for the *Glasgow City.* The workflow focuses on the following steps:

1. **Data Selection:** Identification of the relevant data
2. **Geography Selection:** Veryfying name of geogrphy for which we want to source data
3. Sourcing
4. Pre-processing and feeding data for analysis

## 1. Data Selection

The package comes with an embedded data sets containing list of data and geographies available through the [statistics.gov.scot](http://statistics.gov.scot) endpoint. To see the list of available data sets refer to the `data("available_data_sets")` objects. The `available_data_sets` contains `subject` column that can be used to identify relevant data, as shown below.

```{r get_available_data, eval=FALSE}
data("available_data_sets")
subset.data.frame(x = available_data_sets, 
                  subset = grepl(pattern = "expectancy", x = subject))
```
```{r show_available_data, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  subset.data.frame(x = available_data_sets, 
                  subset = grepl(pattern = "expectancy", x = subject)),
  caption = "Available Life Expectancy Data"
)
```

## 2. Geography

The object `data("standard_geography_code_register")` is provided to facilitate veryfying existence of the geography we are interested in. Similarly, as in the previous step we can use `grep()` to verify existence of that object in the provided data frame.

```{r show_available_geographies}
data("standard_geography_code_register")
```
```{r table_available_geographies, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(standard_geography_code_register))
```

## 3. Sourcing

## 4. Pre-processing and Analysis

# Conclusion

For the efficiency the objects `data("available_data_sets")` and `data("standard_geography_code_register")` are provided in the package. Those objects are not updated too freqntely and providing them as statics data sets makes sense from the efficiency perspective. It is however possible to source live the mentioned objects. This is discussed in `vignette("support-functions")`.
