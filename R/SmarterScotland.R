#' @section Acknowledgements:
#' The following package is written in the open (both metaphorically and literally as I tend do undertake this development as a leisure reactivity while working on the Glasgow - Edinburgh commuter train), with big thanks to the whole Open Source community that contributed useful input through their questions, answers, discussions and comments via StackOverflow, GitHub and R-Help.
